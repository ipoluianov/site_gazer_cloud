<h1>Simple</h1>

<p>
    The main goal of the project is to provide easy remote access to system parameters 
    without the need to maintain infrastructure. 
    This limits the application of Gazer in corporate environments where 
    the number of parameters can reach tens of thousands. 
    For such tasks, there are excellent projects available.

    These projects are typically designed for specific use cases, 
    such as enterprise networks, microservices applications, or industrial processes. 
    However, when there is a need to quickly set up monitoring for hundreds of parameters, 
    Gazer can be a useful solution.

    Gazer is a good answer to questions like:

    <li> "How can I record the memory usage history of a program?"</li>
    <li>"How can I retrieve information from my Arduino on my mobile phone?"</li>
    In these scenarios, Gazer can provide a convenient and efficient solution.
