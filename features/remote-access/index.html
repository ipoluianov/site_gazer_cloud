<h1>Remote Access</h1>
<p>
You can connect not only to a local node but also to remote ones. 
To do this, you need to know their address and access key. 
There is no need for an external IP address or router configuration. 
Communication takes place through special routers provided by the project. 
The connection is fully secure as it utilizes end-to-end encryption 
between the client program and the node.
