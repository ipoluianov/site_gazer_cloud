<h1 class="sensor_name">Why did I do it this way</h1>

<h2>Why Open Source</h2>
<div class="sensor_description">
Because this program can collect a lot of data from different sources, and I think the user wants to know what is being sent to where.
Open source allows you to control the behavior of the program.
</div>

<h2>Why is file storage used instead of a DBMS</h2>
<div class="sensor_description">
GazerNode is a relatively simple system designed to painlessly organize and manage data collection.
Its philosophy is a thing in itself. There are many other systems on the market for organizing complex monitoring systems at the enterprise level.
</div>

<h2>Why own graphics library</h2>
<div class="sensor_description">
Existing graphics libraries carry many dependencies. I've tried many of them.
Licensing, linking to components and runtimes. I wanted to have one executable that could be easily portable.
</div>

<h2>Why GoLang</h2>
<div class="sensor_description">
I fell in love with this language as soon as I started learning it. Before that, I had a lot of experience using C++.
More specific:
<li>One executable file without dependencies</li>
<li>Simplicity so you can focus on the task</li>
<li>Easy dependency management</li>
<li>C like syntax</li>
